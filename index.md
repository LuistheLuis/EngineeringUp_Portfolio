# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've stripped away a lot of the parts that were originally on the robot to create room for my kicking arm. I changed the code a lot to accommodate the second H-Bridge which I go more in-depth about in my video below. I've loved this journey so far and I can't wait to see where this takes me in my future career.

# Second Milestone 

My second milestone was me being able to code the microcontroler to have Billy move with a controller. I also have enough knowlege to explain in detail how the IR reciver works with a controler. I used this Arduino schematic to assist me witch is available here https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/3in1-kit/en/latest/_images/car_remote.png.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to wire the arduino to then make it move via wires. Then i was able to code the Arduino IDE allowing it to move via the microcontroller the  Arduino IDE.
