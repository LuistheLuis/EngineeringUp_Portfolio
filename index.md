# Sir Kickington, the coded robot car
I am working on a code powered car that runs off code I made in the Arudino IDE software which works in tandem with the Arduino microcontroller. During this project I will add my own creative spin to the project and creat something amazingly unique.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've stripped away a lot of the parts that were originally on the robot to create room for my kicking arm. While my first idea was a punching boxing glove, I ran into complications so I had to compromise with an equally as fun kick! I changed the code a lot to accommodate the second H-Bridge which I go more in-depth about in my video below. I've loved this journey so far and I can't wait to see where this takes me in my future career.






# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the Arudino Uno microcontroller is and how an H-Bridge works.
