# Coded Robot Car
I am working on a code powered car that runs off code I made in the Arudino IDE software which works in tandem with the Arduino microcontroller. During this project I will add my own creative spin to the project and creat something amazingly unique.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the Arudino Uno microcontroller is and how an H-Bridge works
